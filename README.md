# Perl syntax highlighting extension for Nova

This extension utilizes the Tree Sitter engine introduced in Nova 10 and aims to bring more accurate syntax highlighting for the Perl language.

This extension is based entirely on the work of [tree-sitter-perl](https://github.com/tree-sitter-perl/tree-sitter-perl) and adapted here for the Nova text editor.
