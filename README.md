The majority of work is based on [tree-sitter-perl](https://github.com/tree-sitter-perl/tree-sitter-perl) and adapted here for the Nova text editor.

Support for [Mojo::Template](https://docs.mojolicious.org/Mojo/Template) files is also provided by [tree-sitter-mojo-template](https://github.com/mrsdizzie/tree-sitter-mojo-template)
